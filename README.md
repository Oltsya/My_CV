## General Information
- Here you can see my first attempt to create a CV using HTML and CSS. It's pretty raw, but at least I tried to do it.


## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS


## Structure
The repository consists of:
- css folder with 2 files: reset.css and style.css
- img folder with my photo inside
- index.html file with all the necessary info


## Project Status
The repository is not finished yet, so some new code will appear here from time to time.


## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by "HTML_CSS Marathon" by GoIt and based on its tasks.
